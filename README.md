## Movie Portfolio Project in Python

Welcome to the **Movie Portfolio Project in Python** repository! This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing movie data to gain insights into correlations among various attributes and performing data cleaning tasks. Whether you're a movie enthusiast or a data science enthusiast, this project provides valuable experience in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using Python.

### Project Overview

In this project, we perform the following key tasks:

1. **Data Loading:** We start by loading movie data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning:** We perform data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We explore the dataset using statistical summaries, distribution plots, and correlation analysis.
4. **Correlation Heatmap:** We create a correlation heatmap using Seaborn to visualize correlations between movie attributes.
5. **Data Visualization:** We use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various visualizations that help us understand the data better.
6. **Insights Generation:** Based on our analysis and visualizations, we draw meaningful insights about the movie dataset.

### Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the movie dataset file(s).
- `notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter Notebooks where data cleaning, EDA, and visualization are performed.
  - `data_cleaning.ipynb`: Demonstrates data cleaning techniques.
  - `eda_and_visualization.ipynb`: Focuses on exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- `images/`: Stores images of the visualizations generated during the project.
- `README.md`: You're reading it right now! It provides an overview of the project and its components.

### How to Use the Notebooks

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie_portfolio_project_python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the `data_cleaning.ipynb` and `eda_and_visualization.ipynb` notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebooks to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization tasks.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
